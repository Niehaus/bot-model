# Signifies our desired python version
# Makefile macros (or variables) are defined a little bit differently than traditional bash, keep in mind that in the Makefile there's top-level Makefile-only syntax, and everything else is bash script syntax.

# .PHONY defines parts of the makefile that are not dependant on any specific file
# This is most often used to store functions

# Defines the default target that `make` will to try to make, or in the case of a phony target, execute the specified commands
# This target is executed whenever we just type `make`

# The @ makes sure that the command itself isn't echoed in the terminal

# This generates the desired project file structure
# A very important thing to note is that macros (or makefile variables) are referenced in the target's code with a single dollar sign ${}, but all script variables are referenced with two dollar signs $${}
setup:

	${PYTHON} setup.py

# The ${} notation is specific to the make syntax and is very similar to bash's $()
# This function uses pytest to test our source files
test:

# In this context, the *.project pattern means "anything that has the .project extension"
